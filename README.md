# Accurate Starfield
Accurate starfield generator based on real-world star data sets gathered relative to Earth. Makes use of GPU instancing to render over 8912 quad meshes in a single draw call with a custom shader pass for each, rendering each star based on its Apparent Magnitude and Colour Index.
